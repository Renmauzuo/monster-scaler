                summary Using this tool
                p This tool was created to scale certain monsters up or down a few levels to make them useable as summons or wild shape forms for a wider range of levels. Feel free to use this calculator however you like, though caution is advised when scaling low CR monsters up to very high levels, or vice versa. While stats like hp, damage, and ability scores are scaled up and down the tool currently does not adjust things like resistances, immunities, or legendary abilities. Scaling a high CR monster down to low levels may not be appropriate for a low level party as its abilities would still make it very powerful, while a low CR creature scaled up to very high levels may have appropriate stats but would lack the resistances and immunities commonly found at the higher CR. In particular be wary of scaling CR 0 monsters. Since the average stats for CR 0 are so low even a few points of variation can lead to a creature with vastly above average stat values at higher CRs.
            details
                summary How it works 
                p This tool works by comparing a creature's stats to a list of averages for its original CR, then applying that to averages for its new CR. For example, if a creature has 150% of the average strength for its original CR then it will have roughly 150% (rounded) of average strength at its scaled CR. Some of the averages were taken from the "Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating" table in the Dungeon Masters Guide; others were calculated by averaging the stats of many existing creatures.
